## 2. Project Description
We intend to design a second-hand marketplace app for people looking to buy or sell unwanted items locally. When you need to make space, whether because you are looking to relocate or declutter, our storing service will take your items off your hands immediately. Sellers can deposit their items in nearby partner warehouses, where they are securely stored until sold. This ensures valuable items are not wasted and allows users to focus on their next steps without stress.  

The app integrates Google Maps API to locate storage facilities near the seller's current position, making it easy to choose the most convenient option. Once stored, items are listed on our platform with detailed descriptions and photos. Additionally, our app offers a price recommendation and comparison feature. It analyzes our database of similar second-hand items and their past transaction prices to suggest a fair and competitive price for sellers. Furthermore, the app compares the recommended price with the market price of similar new items from other platforms, highlighting how much buyers can save by purchasing through our platform. This innovative approach not only ensures competitive pricing for sellers but also maximizes buyer satisfaction by demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of purchasing second-hand items through our app.  

Buyers benefit from a personalized recommendation system and real-time chat functionality, ensuring smooth communication and a tailored shopping experience. Whether buyers prefer self-pickup from the warehouse or delivery, the app simplifies the entire process, making second-hand trading faster, more efficient, and ultimately more rewarding for all users.
